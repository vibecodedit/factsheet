# Contributing to FACT SHEET

Thank you for your interest in improving FACT SHEET! We welcome contributions that make the template more useful for IT operations teams.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you find a problem with the template or have a suggestion:

1. Check existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. Open a new issue describing:
   - What section or part of the template is affected
   - What the problem is or what improvement you're suggesting
   - Why this change would help IT teams

### Submitting Changes

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a branch** for your changes: `git checkout -b improve-monitoring-section`
3. **Make your changes** to the template
4. **Test** your changes by filling out the modified template for a real application
5. **Commit** with a clear message: `git commit -m "Add container orchestration section"`
6. **Push** to your fork: `git push origin improve-monitoring-section`
7. **Open a Pull Request** with:
   - Description of what you changed
   - Why the change is useful

## What We're Looking For

Good contributions to FACT SHEET:

- **Add missing operational details** that IT staff frequently need
- **Improve clarity** of instructions or field descriptions
- **Add common scenarios** to troubleshooting sections
- **Keep it simple** - remember, simplicity is what prevents documentation rot

What we're NOT looking for:

- Making the template more complex or harder to fill out
- Adding fields that require specialized tools to populate
- Theoretical information that doesn't help during incidents
- Changes that make the template specific to one technology or platform

## Template Philosophy

When contributing, keep these principles in mind:

1. **Simple beats comprehensive** - It's better to have 80% filled out than 100% planned but 20% completed
2. **Operational focus** - Information should help someone respond to an incident or make a change
3. **Technology agnostic** - The template should work for any application stack
4. **Markdown only** - No dependencies, no build process, no special tools required

## Questions?

Open an issue for discussion before spending time on large changes. We're happy to provide guidance!
